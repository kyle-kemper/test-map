The best way to wrap up Valentines Weekend! 

We'll be running and hiking the Daliah Bell Trail (aka meadow trail). The entire loop is 1.5 miles, but you can cut out a shorter distance if you like, or run it multiple times. The trail is mostly flat with one small technical section. Please park at the visitor center/general market next to the campground.

If you are new to canicross and want to try it out, I have extra belts, harnesses, and lines. Just send me a message so I can make sure I have your dog’s size!🙂

This is one of the flattest, potentially fastest, and (arguably) most scenic 5K trail runs in Westchester. We're talking a whopping 94 feet of ascent over the duration with a lot of single track and technical bits that include dirt, mud, sand, and rock surfaces, with just enough root to keep one super focused. This is an out and back run and we will keep the pace appropriate to whomever shows to work on running with other canicrossers and overtaking/directional commands. The trail head parking lot is small, additional parking is available on the shoulder of the road. No admission or parking fees. Interested, though don't want to run with your dog yet, or are hoping to have a dog soon, feel free to show up and say hello or even better run along without a dog.
