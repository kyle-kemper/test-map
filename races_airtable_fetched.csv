We've had numbers close to requiring a Boulder County group permit for this location before, so having a head count ahead of time is helpful so that we have time to apply for a permit if needed 🙂
Plan to arrive by 8:45 or earlier, we will be hitting the trail by 9:00am sharp! We will plan on meeting at the main Lagerman Reservoir parking area, overflow parking available at the intersection of Pike and 75th. We will do a round of introductions for all people and dogs before we head out.
Route options include the 5-mile Open Sky Loop, with shorter distances available for those interested! We typically have a longer distance group and a shorter-distance group.
Terrain: This is an on-leash restricted area, bikes are allowed, but it is typically pretty quiet. Mostly flat gravel/dirt, some rolling hills. Wide enough trail to talk and meet new people at conversation pace!
Beginners are welcome, we may have some extra bungee lines, belts, etc... At a minimum, have a non-restrictive harness for your dog and ideally a bungee leash. In a pinch, a climbing harness can help you get a feel for the sport!
We want to make this an inclusive sport for all dogs, we do frequently have some shy and also dog reactive dogs participating. We have a color-coded bandana system to help all dogs and runners feel comfortable. Please do not allow dogs to great each other unless you have permission from owners first!
Hope to see you there!

We will meet at the parking lot off of Ring Road across from the Elizabethtown Nature Park. We will be doing an out and back of the unpaved trail on the eastern side of the lake, approximately 4 miles. All skill levels and speeds welcome, you can do as much or as little of the route as you would like. Please keep your and your dog’s physical limitations and current fitness level in mind when participating. You do not need to be a NACC member to participate. 

Since this is intended to be an opportunity to learn about canicross it is not necessary to have a full canicross setup. However, no flexi-leashes, face halters, or “no-pull” harnesses will be allowed. A non-restrictive Y-front harness is preferred along with a bungee leash if available. Dogs must be 12 months or older for their safety. 

NACC has a strict “No greet” policy for the safety of all participating dogs. Please do not let your dog approach other dogs or humans and provide space if passing on the trail. 

You must sign a waiver if you haven't done so before: https://nacanicross.fillout.com/t/dQrpDEnWaEus.

Your dog is required to be ON LEASH at all times. No exceptions. 

Be sure to clean up after yourself and your dog. 

What is canicross?
Canicross is running cross country with your dog. The difference between canicross and just regular trail running your dog, is that canicross is powered by the dog! Special harnesses are used to allow the dog to have optimal and comfortable pulling. Dogs are connected by a bungee lead: no longer than 6 feet, which is then attached to a special running belt on their owner. The belt and bungee lead allow for shock absorbency and keep the owner from any back injury. The dog may be pulling, but the owner is the driver! Dogs are taught special commands for things like ""left"", ""right"", ""slow down"", ""speed up"" etc. The goal is to work as a team to get to the finish line!

What is North American Canicross (NACC)?
North American Canicross (NACC) was founded in June of 2019 for the purpose of promoting Canicross as a competitive sport in the United States. North American Canicross’ program includes the LIFETIME ACHIEVED MILES, RACE DOG DISTANCE, and CHAMPIONSHIP TITLES which have similar structures, but different competition standards for the canicross enthusiast. All events are open to any and all persons without discrimination who shall exhibit good sportsmanship and uphold the standards set forth in these rules and regulations. All breeds and skill levels welcome! Teams must be registered in order to compete in North American Canicross events and titling programs. Find out more about registering your team and the titling program at https://nacanicross.com/about.

All skills and fitness levels are more than welcome, while my border collie may be fast, rest assured, I am significantly slower!
All leashed canine running buddies are welcome! NACC does not promote on leash meetings for strange dogs, so please communicate with others and give space when needed.
If you're experienced in canicross, great, but if you're simply interested and want to know more, that's what this is for! Dog not required, let's run and learn about all the fun and benefits of canicross!

Participation in this race is not required, I just thought it would be a fun way to support the VA ambassador (and you get a t-shirt and a medal for participating!). You can sign-up here: https://runsignup.com/.../TheRehabRoverCanicrossandTrailRace

We will meet in the parking lot behind the Meade Activity Center. This trail is an out and back and does have hills and uneven ground.

Since this is intended to be an opportunity to learn about canicross it is not necessary to have a full canicross setup. However, no flexi-leashes, face halters, or “no-pull” harnesses will be allowed. A non-restrictive Y-front harness is preferred along with a bungee leash if available. Dogs must be 12 months or older for their safety.

NACC has a strict “No greet” policy for the safety of all participating dogs. Please do not let your dog approach other dogs or humans and provide space if passing on the trail.

You must sign a waiver if you haven't done so before: https://nacanicross.fillout.com/t/dQrpDEnWaEus.

Your dog is required to be ON LEASH at all times. No exceptions.

Be sure to clean up after yourself and your dog.

","rec7UfKOV4cpkudHL","https://nacanicross.fillout.com/t/i7gVYy8GSWus?id=rec7UfKOV4cpkudHL","Come join us for a canicross run and learn about the sport!

We will meet at the Freeman Lake parking lot off of Ring Road across from the Elizabethtown Nature Park. We will be doing an out and back of the unpaved trail on the eastern side of the lake, approximately 4 miles. All skill levels and speeds are welcome, you can do as much or as little of the route as you would like. Please keep your and your dog’s physical limitations and current fitness level in mind when participating. You do not need to be a NACC member to participate.

Since this is intended to be an opportunity to learn about canicross it is not necessary to have a full canicross setup. However, no flexi-leashes, face halters, or “no-pull” harnesses will be allowed. A non-restrictive Y-front harness is preferred along with a bungee leash if available.

NACC has a strict “No greet” policy. Please do not let your dog approach other dogs or humans and provide space if passing on the trail.

You must sign a waiver if you haven't done so before: https://nacanicross.fillout.com/t/dQrpDEnWaEus.

Your dog is required to be ON LEASH at all times. No exceptions.

Be sure to clean up after yourself and your dog.

What is canicross?
Canicross is running cross country with your dog. The difference between canicross and just regular trail running your dog, is that canicross is powered by the dog! Special harnesses are used to allow the dog to have optimal and comfortable pulling. Dogs are connected by a bungee lead: no longer than 6 feet, which is then attached to a special running belt on their owner. The belt and bungee lead allow for shock absorbency and keep the owner from any back injury. The dog may be pulling, but the owner is the driver! Dogs are taught special commands for things like ""left"", ""right"", ""slow down"", ""speed up"" etc. The goal is to work as a team to get to the finish line!

What is North American Canicross (NACC)?

We'll meet at the Van Atta Road entrance to Ted Black Woods.

One loop (plus the yellow route to and from parking lot) is just 1.65 miles, making it a great distance to run while dressed up.
My personal plan would be to drop the costumes at the parking lot and go for a second run around the blue loop.
Hope to see you there!

COME RUN WITH US!
WHAT IS CANICROSS?
Canicross, or cross-country trail running with dogs, came about when the dog sledding community needed a way to cross-train their teams in the off-season. Because of this, the original canicross dogs were primarily traditional mushing breeds. The popularity of canicross as a stand-alone sport has led to a significant increase in breed variety, now including pure and mixed breeds of all shapes and sizes! What sets canicross apart from regular trail running with your dog is that canicross is powered by the dog! Special harnesses are used to allow the dog to have optimal and comfortable pulling. They are connected by a bungee lead—no longer than 9 feet when fully extended—which is then attached to a special running belt on their owner. The belt and bungee lead allow for shock absorbency and protect the owner from back injury. The dog may be pulling, but the owner is the driver! Dogs are taught special commands for things like ""left"", ""right"", ""slow down"", ""speed up"" etc. The objective is for the owner and dog to work as a team to reach the finish line!
WHO IS NACC?
North American Cancross (NACC) was founded in June of 2019 for the purpose of promoting Canicross as a competitive sport in the United States. Canicross is meant to highlight the fundamental elements of a dog and human running team: strength, confidence, speed, communication and all around athleticism. NACC events seeks to maintain and promote the highest standards for competition in canicross for dog and human running teams and canine sports enthusiasts at all different levels. NACC's standards for competition purposes are to ensure a safe activity for dogs when properly conditioned for the demands of the sport.

There are 11 miles of trails through shady forest to train on, and they all loop within a small area. This is a great park to switch dogs out as everything loops back to the parking lot. Parking is secure but there is no water, shade, or facilities on site so plan accordingly. As it cools off, most of the trails are suitable for bikejor too if you incorporate that with your running. This is the site of the Capitolina Dryland Challenge in January, and I can point you towards the race route if you want to preview.

There’s a 2 1/2 ish mile loop that we can do as many or as few times as you and your dog are feeling it that day. All paces and levels welcome!!  We’ll start at the W.B. Simpson elementary school and take the trail to the park loop. There’s an AllTrails link and directions are below, it looks to be not insanely hot so it will be a good time!  I’ll have plenty of water for people and pups.  Please feel free to reach out with any questions!  See you there!

All skill levels and speeds are welcome, you can do as much or as little of the route as you would like. Please keep you and your dog’s physical limitations and current fitness level in mind when participating. You do not need to be a NACC member to participate.

Since this is intended to be an opportunity to learn about canicross it is not necessary to have a full canicross setup. A non-restrictive Y-front harness is preferred along with a bungee leash if available. 
I had extras though so let me know if ya want to try everything! 

NACC has a strict “No greet” policy. Please do not let your dog approach other dogs or humans and provide space if passing on the trail. 

You must sign a waiver if you haven't done so before: https://nacanicross.fillout.com/t/dQrpDEnWaEus.

Your dog is required to be ON LEASH at all times. No exceptions. 

Be sure to clean up after yourself and your dog. 

What is canicross?
Canicross is running cross country with your dog. The difference between canicross and just regular trail running your dog, is that canicross is powered by the dog! Special harnesses are used to allow the dog to have optimal and comfortable pulling. Dogs are connected by a bungee lead: no longer than 6 feet, which is then attached to a special running belt on their owner. The belt and bungee lead allow for shock absorbency and keep the owner from any back injury. The dog may be pulling, but the owner is the driver! Dogs are taught special commands for things like ""left"", ""right"", ""slow down"", ""speed up"" etc. The goal is to work as a team to get to the finish line!

What is North American Canicross (NACC)?
North American Canicross (NACC) was founded in June of 2019 for the purpose of promoting Canicross as a competitive sport in the United States. North American Canicross’ program includes the LIFETIME ACHIEVED MILES, RACE DOG DISTANCE, and CHAMPIONSHIP TITLES which have similar structures, but different competition standards for the canicross enthusiast. All events are open to any and all persons without discrimination who shall exhibit good sportsmanship and uphold the standards set forth in these rules and regulations. All breeds and skill levels welcome! Teams must be registered in order to compete in North American Canicross events and titling programs. Find out more about registering your team and the titling program at https://nacanicross.com/about. 

Please come, bring friends with or without dogs.

All fitness levels are welcome, and we generally run an out-and back route, so whether you're a seasoned runner or just starting out, you'll have a blast running with your four-legged friend.
\*depending on weather we may use multiuse trail into Umstead (wide double track trails) or the lake trail into Lake Crabtree County Park (single track trails).
What you need to know:
-As a general rule, please respect all dogs' space during canicross, and absolutely no on-leash, nose to nose greetings. This is not an event for dogs to be social with others, please keep space between your dog and the dog in front of you, and announce if you're going to be passing. This is a reactive dog friendly group.
-Gear: A Waist belt, bungee leash, and y-front harness are all you need to get started. We have plenty of extra belts/bungee lines to try, and can help with fitting equipment too!
-We are not the fastest/slowest group out there, and all speeds are welcome (even those who need to hike)! If we are on the singletrack trails, we ensure no one is dropped. However as the double track trail is an out and back, I cannot not guarantee someone will always be with you, but we do ensure everyone makes it back to the parking lot 🙂
We cancel for thunderstorms and extreme heat

Come join us for a casual weekly meet up at the GE Trails to get in whatever kind of training your team needs. There are 11 miles of trails through shady forest to train on, and they all loop within a small area. This is a great park to switch dogs out as everything loops back to the parking lot. Parking is secure but there is no water, shade, or facilities on site so plan accordingly. As it cools off, most of the trails are suitable for bikejor too if you incorporate that with your running. This is the site of the Capitolina Dryland Challenge in January, and I can point you towards the race route if you want to preview. If you have any particular training needs or are just getting started and want to talk gear or starting a dog, we can always do that - just let me know!

WHAT IS CANICROSS?
Canicross, or cross-country trail running with dogs, came about when the dog sledding community needed a way to cross-train their teams in the off-season. Because of this, the original canicross dogs were primarily traditional mushing breeds. The popularity of canicross as a stand-alone sport has led to a significant increase in breed variety, now including pure and mixed breeds of all shapes and sizes! What sets canicross apart from regular trail running with your dog is that canicross is powered by the dog! Special harnesses are used to allow the dog to have optimal and comfortable pulling. They are connected by a bungee lead—no longer than 9 feet when fully extended—which is then attached to a special running belt on their owner. The belt and bungee lead allow for shock absorbency and protect the owner from back injury. The dog may be pulling, but the owner is the driver! Dogs are taught special commands for things like ""left"", ""right"", ""slow down"", ""speed up"" etc. The objective is for the owner and dog to work
as a team to reach the finish line!

WHO IS NACC?
North American Cancross (NACC) was founded in June of 2019 for the purpose of promoting Canicross as a competitive sport in the United States. Canicross is meant to highlight the fundamental elements of a dog and human running team: strength, confidence, speed, communication and all around athleticism. NACC events seeks to maintain and promote the highest standards for competition in canicross for dog and human running teams and canine sports enthusiasts at all different levels. NACC's standards for competition purposes are to ensure a safe activity for dogs when properly conditioned for the demands of the sport.

Someone had the genius idea to head over to Wheeler Wildlife Refuge and check out the Cranes wintering over. Plus, there's a brand new Trailhead right before you enter the gates to the Refuge. It's 5.5 miles (out and back) of flat, fine crushed gravel that borders fields for the birds and wooded trails that alternate. Perfect spot for Bikejor and/or Canicross/Canihike.

We’ll start running at 8:30 am; I’ll arrive by 8:15 am. Parking at this trailhead often fills up later on weekend mornings. There’s also an additional parking lot 1.6 miles away (the turnaround point). Restrooms are available at the trailhead.

Parking: https://maps.app.goo.gl/uPyjbw954q65uaBEA
(I’ll be starting from the Columns Drive side.)
Route: https://www.strava.com/routes/3447796185085096840

Route details
We’ll run an out-and-back on the Cochran Shoals River path; 1.6 miles each way (3.2 miles total). Feel free to turn around early for a shorter run or do multiple laps if you’d like more distance. For the first lap, we’ll stick to the wide main path.

New to canicross?
Curious about canicross or thinking about getting started? You’re very welcome to join us! A full canicross setup is not required to attend or learn. All speeds and distances are welcome. 

Safety & guidelines
For dog safety, flexi-leashes, head halters, and “no-pull” harnesses are not permitted, and participating dogs must be 12 months or older. A non-restrictive Y-front harness is preferred along with a bungee leash if available

NACC follows a strict “no-greet” policy. Please keep dogs from approaching other dogs or people and allow space when passing. Dogs must remain on leash at all times (no exceptions).

Please clean up after yourself and your dog.
Note Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area is a fee parking area

If you haven’t already, please sign the waiver before attending:

Come enjoy a 4-5ish (rough guess) miles with a lake view! The trails around Lake Williams include multiple terrains, rocks and roots, some single track, and a paved section. There are options to turn around early if you don't want to complete the full route. No judgment here. If you have a good time, consider joining the NACC relay team at the raece! Your one lap commitment is about 5.7 miles.
You must sign a waiver if you haven't done so before. Everyone is welcome!: https://nacanicross.fillout.com/t/dQrpDEnWaEus .
Our path follows an All Trails map (below) with some changes. We will use the North Shore trail to extend the loop right of the parking area (crossing S. George St). Instead of taking the South Shore loop out and back on the left side, we will utilize Water St. on the return (road is foot traffic only/ no vehicles). There is one tricky road crossing at S. George St. This first road cross has a trail on the other side that is hidden until you get to it. After your cross, go North and the trail will be on your right. See ""discussion"" section for images. https://www.alltrails.com/.../lake-williams-trail-4-4a-4b
Parking. If your GPS tries to take you on water Street through Lake Williams, do not go that way. The road over Lake Williams is closed to through traffic. You have to drive through Jacobus. https://maps.app.goo.gl/1CUDB8SAfGFsA5tf9
PLEASE RSVP! to confirm if you are going.
Your dog is required to be ON LEASH at all times. No exceptions. LEAVE NO TRACE: Clean up after yourself and your dog.

Everyone is welcome, all shapes, sizes, paces…pretty much anyone who likes dogs! This location is flat, wide and inviting, and has mostly packed gravel footing. It runs along White Clay Creek and there are spots for your dog to cool off and take a dip in the creek if they’d like to. It’s shaded for the majority of the trail as well so we can try to stay cool in this warmer weather. As far as distance is concerned we’ve got a lot of options; usually 2-3 miles will get us through a nice loop, but there’s flexibility to go more or less if we’re feeling it!
There is a fee for the state park at this lot, the link below has more information for Delaware State Parks. There are bathrooms here as well, and I’ll have plenty of water for humans and dogs if needed! Please feel free to reach out with any questions, and I hope to see you there!

","recOeiOKapTNUBnVg","https://nacanicross.fillout.com/t/i7gVYy8GSWus?id=recOeiOKapTNUBnVg","Come join us for our weekly Canicross group run on Thursday evenings at the Old Reedy Creek Road Trailhead! 

All fitness levels are welcome, and we generally run an out-and back route, so whether you're a seasoned runner or just starting out, you'll have a blast running with your four-legged friend.

\*depending on weather we may use multiuse trail into Umstead (wide double track trails) or the lake trail into Lake Crabtree County Park (single track trails). 

What you need to know:
-As a general rule, please respect all dogs' space during canicross, and absolutely no on-leash, nose to nose greetings. This is not an event for dogs to be social with others, please keep space between your dog and the dog in front of you, and announce if you're going to be passing. This is a reactive dog friendly group.

-Gear: A Waist belt, bungee leash, and y-front harness are all you need to get started. We have plenty of extra belts/bungee lines to try, and can help with fitting equipment too!

-We are not the fastest/slowest group out there, and all speeds are welcome (even those who need to hike)! If we are on the singletrack trails, we ensure no one is dropped. However as the double track trail is an out and back, I cannot not guarantee someone will always be with you, but we do ensure everyone makes it back to the parking lot :) 

We cancel for thunderstorms and extreme heat.

This is a great trail for the summer heat as a majority of the trail is shade covered by trees.

We will meet at the parking lot off of Ring Road across from the Elizabethtown Nature Park. We will be doing an out and back (run or walk) of the unpaved trail on the eastern side of the lake, approximately 4 miles. All skill levels and speeds welcome, you can do as much or as little of the route as you would like. Please keep your and your dog’s physical limitations and current fitness level in mind when participating. You do not need to be a NACC member to participate. 

Since this is intended to be an opportunity to learn about canicross it is not necessary to have a full canicross setup. However, no flexi-leashes, face halters, or “no-pull” harnesses will be allowed. A non-restrictive Y-front harness is preferred along with a bungee leash if available. Dogs must be 12 months or older for their safety. 

NACC has a strict “No greet” policy for the safety of all participating dogs. Please do not let your dog approach other dogs or humans and provide space if passing on the trail. 

You must sign a waiver if you haven't done so before: https://nacanicross.fillout.com/t/dQrpDEnWaEus.

Your dog is required to be ON LEASH at all times. No exceptions. 

Be sure to clean up after yourself and your dog.

While weather permits, I am hoping to continue bouncing around various parks every Sunday at 11AM. If you have any specific location requests, I am game for recommendations 🥰 Additionally, for those who don’t know me personally or maybe haven’t joined us for a meet up previously, I do 2-3 laps at all locations as I am rebuilding with a dog post-knee surgery, so if an interval run/walk sounds more appealing to you please feel free to message me as you would be welcome to join us for a lap before or after the one that’s scheduled. 

LOCATION SPECIFIC INFORMATION : this property has three small parking lots in close proximity on the same driveway, however parking is not permitted in the adjacent business’ lot. There is a porta-john on site.

We will meet at the northwest side of the Meadows Parking Lot. The run will generally use trails that follow the Cross River upstream to the Kimberly Bridge Parking area and then back. Pacing will be dependent on who shows. This is a meetup, the goal is to have fun, learn, and get a nice run in, though not to drop anyone. Terrain is varied, there are small hills, flatter bits, wide trail sections and singletrack all with mixed surfaces including, grass, dirt, a short bit of item 4, roots, mud, rocks, and wood bridges surfaced with chicken wire. Remember the reservation does charge a daily access fee payable in cash at the gate; see their website for pricing. This is a small introduction to the great trail system available in the reservation.

This trail is a quad burner with elevation gains, so there are times where we may slow down or hike. There are some side trails looping back or you may turn around early if you don't want to complete the full route. No judgment here. While I don't expect to see any any hunters on this trail while we are there, hunting is permitted on Miller Mountain, so please wear bright colors if you have them(Safety 1st).

Come join us for a casual weekly meet up at the GE Trails to get in whatever kind of training your team needs. There are 11 miles of trails through shady forest to train on, and they all loop within a small area. This is a great park to switch dogs out as everything loops back to the parking lot. Parking is secure but there is no water, shade, or facilities on site so plan accordingly. As it cools off, most of the trails are suitable for bikejor too if you incorporate that with your running. This is the site of the Capitolina Dryland Challenge in January, and I can point you towards the race route if you want to preview. If you have any particular training needs or are just getting started and want to talk gear or starting a dog, we can always do that - just let me know!

This is a fun single width trail! This would be great for someone just starting out either walking or jogging.

This trail can reach up to 4 miles but is easy to cut short. There are some hills/stairs so that will be a little bit more of a workout.

We will have a walking group and a running group!

If you are planning on attending, please keep a close eye on event updates, since in the case of heavy snow we will move the meetup location to Lagerman Reservoir in Longmont. Please also keep your RSVP up to date, we've had some meetup attendance numbers approaching the level where we would need group permits (yay!). RSVPs help us plan in the even that we need to apply for a permit ahead of time.
Plan to arrive 8:45 or earlier, we will be hitting the trail by 9:00am sharp. There are several parking areas, so we will plan on meeting up at the picnic shelter in the map posted in the discussion. Multiple distances possible, there is a 3-mile and also a 6.5+ mile loop, shorter-out-and-backs also possible.
Terrain: This is an on-leash area, no mountain bikes are allowed on Saturdays. Rolling, hilly terrain, not as flat as some of our other meetups and at a higher elevation. Trees/shade, some more open areas. ""Mountain vistas, views of golden plains, scenic trails, diverse habitats, and a rich heritage make Betasso Preserve a favorite destination in the foothills.""
Beginners are very welcome, we always have a few extra bungee lines, belts, etc... If you are interested in investing in gear but are unsure on sizing you can ask people for help or to try on their gear. At a minimum please have a non-restrictive harness, y-shaped harness for your dog and ideally a bungee leash and waist-belt.
We want to make this an inclusive sport for all dogs, we do frequently have some shy or reactive dogs participating. Please do not allow dogs to great each other unless you have permission from owners first. Keep your leashes at a manageable length and respect everyone’s space. We will also use a bandana system to indicate dog’s social level.

The wooded trails can have a bit of elevation. I plan to have us run on both the grass fields and through the wooded trails, so be prepared for a some elevation through the woods!

Come join us for a casual weekly meet up at the GE Trails to get in whatever kind of training your team needs. There are 11 miles of trails through shady forest to train on, and they all loop within a small area. This is a great park to switch dogs out as everything loops back to the parking lot. Parking is secure but there is no water, shade, or facilities on site so plan accordingly. As it cools off, most of the trails are suitable for bikejor too if you incorporate that with your running. This is the site of the Capitolina Dryland Challenge in January, and I can point you towards the race route if you want to preview. If you have any particular training needs or are just getting started and want to talk gear or starting a dog, we can always do that - just let me know!

When: Sunday, Dec 22nd @ 1:30 pm
Where: Rail Trail Access; 1 E High St, New Freedom, PA 17349 ; Meet next to rail trail at E. High St.
Pace: Social/Talking Pace
Distance: As far as you want (group goal – 4ish miles, weather pending)
Who: Everyone
It's a great way to celebrate the shortest daylight weekend of the year!
Other: This is a multi-use trial. We will likely encounter walkers, joggers, cyclists, and other dogs. We also may encounter a train or a horse (unlikely but possible). The trail is usually wide enough to give yourself space if needed. There is a parking lot at the rail trail and additional street parking all over town. Try to come early in case you need to walk to the meetup spot. We expect the area will be busy.
You must sign a NACC waiver: https://nacanicross.fillout.com/t/dQrpDEnWaEus
Your dog is required to always be ON LEASH and you must clean up their poo. No exceptions.

The trails around Lake Williams include multiple terrains, rocks and roots, some single track, and a paved section. There are options to turn around early if you don't want to complete the full route. No judgment here.
Our path follows an All Trails map (below) with some changes. We will use the North Shore trail to extend the loop right of the parking area (crossing S. George St). Instead of taking the South Shore loop out and back on the left side, we will utilize Water St. to avoid crossing each other on single track (no cars allowed/ no traffic).

We'll be running and hiking the Daliah Bell Trail (aka meadow trail). The entire loop is 1.5 miles, but you can cut out a shorter distance if you like, or run it multiple times. The trail is mostly flat with one small technical section. Please park at the visitor center/general market next to the campground.

If you are new to canicross and want to try it out, I have extra belts, harnesses, and lines. Just send me a message so I can make sure I have your dog’s size!🙂

Meetup is two events in one, both starting from the Wolf River Greenway Shady Grove Trailhead. All paces and beginner trail runners are welcome!
The 7am start will be a canicross trail run on the Wolf River White/Blue Trail. We will run approximately 4.5 miles at an easy pace.
At 9am, we will hike/walk approximately 2-3 miles on the Blue/Yellow trail for those that simply want a canihike or walking pace.
The Wolf River Trails are flat, non-technical trails located in the Lucius Burch State Natural Area at Shelby Farms Park, and a great place for beginners and experienced runners/hikers alike. The parking lot should have plenty of parking
early in the morning, but fills up fast. There is additional parking at the office building across the street. Feel free to reach out with any questions.

If you'd like to know more or have been running with your canine companion for years, come join us for a canicross meet up. Learn about the sport in an EXTREMELY low stakes environment. For this meet up, we will meet at the Mead’s Quarry parking lot at IJAMs. Runners will gather by the public restrooms next to River Sports. There is plenty of parking by the quarry and paid parking by the visitor’s center. 

What to expect?
We will be running with our canine companions. No worries, this will be a casual jog on the Tharp Trace Trail (only 1 mile and we can do more for the super adventurous). Canicross requires a non-restrictive harness and bungee lead. We can teach you more about gear, but you can bring any non-restrictive harness and lead. Please note that dogs under 12 months are not permitted. We will be trail running so humans should wear durable running shoes and comfortable clothes, and bring hydration for your running pal.

We practice a no-greet policy. Some dogs might be spicy or simply not want to play. Please make sure your dog is leashed at all times.

The Muskegon Luge has some really nice trails and hopefully the fall colors will start to pop.  This will be a good run for any of those who can’t make it south for the Rehab Rover or Steeplechase, but would enjoy hitting the trails with friends.  It will also be a nice recovery run for those running the Midwest Canine Obstacle run the day prior.  I will map out a route that is between 2.5-3 miles.  If you wish to do more than that you can do the loop a second time.  Lake Michigan is right across the street from the parking lot if you wish to let your dog swim after.  MI state park passes are needed for parking.

Do you want to learn more about how to start canicrossing with your dog? Join us for some fun and I’ll help you get started! 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Come join us for a casual weekly meet up at the GE Trails to get in whatever kind of training your team needs. There are 11 miles of trails through shady forest to train on, and they all loop within a small area. This is a great park to switch dogs out as everything loops back to the parking lot. Parking is secure but there is no water, shade, or facilities on site so plan accordingly. As it cools off, most of the trails are suitable for bikejor too if you incorporate that with your running. This is the site of the Capitolina Dryland Challenge in January, and I can point you towards the race route if you want to preview. If you have any particular training needs or are just getting started and want to talk gear or starting a dog, we can always do that - just let me know!

COME RUN WITH US!
WHAT IS CANICROSS?
Canicross, or cross-country trail running with dogs, came about when the dog sledding community needed a way to cross-train their teams in the off-season. Because of this, the original canicross dogs were primarily traditional mushing breeds. The popularity of canicross as a stand-alone sport has led to a significant increase in breed variety, now including pure and mixed breeds of all shapes and sizes! What sets canicross apart from regular trail running with your dog is that canicross is powered by the dog! Special harnesses are used to allow the dog to have optimal and comfortable pulling. They are connected by a bungee lead-no longer than 9 feet when fully extended-which is then attached to a special running belt on their owner. The belt and bungee lead allow for shock absorbency and protect the owner from back injury. The dog may be pulling, but the owner is the driver! Dogs are taught special commands for things like ""left""
"", ""right"", ""slow down"",
""speed up"" etc. The objective is for the owner and dog to work
as a team to reach the finish line!
WHO IS NACC?
North American Cancross (NACC) was founded in June of 2019 for the purpose of promoting Canicross as a competitive sport in the United States. Canicross is meant to highlight the fundamental elements of a dog and human running team: strength, confidence, speed, communication and all around athleticism. NACC events seeks to maintain and promote the highest standards for competition in canicross for dog and human running teams and canine sports enthusiasts at all different levels. NACC's standards for competition purposes are to ensure a safe activity for dogs when properly conditioned for the demands of the sport.

The Wolf River Trails are flat, non-technical trails located in the Lucius Burch State Natural Area at Shelby Farms Park, and a great place for beginners and experienced runners/hikers alike. Feel free to reach out with any questions.

Parking for the meetup will be at Semmes Murphy clinic (6325 Humphreys Blvd, Memphis, TN 38120) directly across the street from the trailhead parking lot, which fills up very fast and very early. Please look for the North American Canicross flag on my car (white Subaru).

Canicross is the sport of trail running while attached to your dog. Dogs typically wear non-restrictive harnesses attached via a bungee line to the human's waist belt.

I will have some canicross gear for new folks to try out!  Although specialized canicross gear is not required to participate, we ask that your dog is leashed and under control. Flexi leashes, gentle leaders, and no-pull harnesses are not allowed at North American Canicross events. 

For safety, dog-dog greetings are not allowed at NACC meetups. This means we don't allow dogs to greet face to face and dogs who don't know each other need to maintain a minimum distance of six feet.

Trail description: Meet at Latte Nature Preserve in the first lot after the gates (see map).  There are bathrooms in this parking lot! The trail is 3-4 miles and the terrain is all wide, packed dirt paths after a very short distance on the road to get to the path.  

This is a NO-DROP run meaning no team will be left behind!

Snacks (and doggy treats) await us back in the parking lot!

Come join us for a casual weekly meet up at the GE Trails to get in whatever kind of training your team needs. There are 11 miles of trails through shady forest to train on, and they all loop within a small area. This is a great park to switch dogs out as everything loops back to the parking lot. Parking is secure but there is no water, shade, or facilities on site so plan accordingly. As it cools off, most of the trails are suitable for bikejor too if you incorporate that with your running. This is the site of the Capitolina Dryland Challenge in January, and I can point you towards the race route if you want to preview. If you have any particular training needs or are just getting started and want to talk gear or starting a dog, we can always do that - just let me know!

We will meet at the Sawtooth trail head parking lot. We will follow the Sawtooth trail and Turkey Run trail in a loop to make up an estimated 3.5 mile course. The trail is single track through the woods. Make sure to were trail shoes if you have them as there will be roots, leaves and rocks. The trails are usually clear to run without issue. This is a relatively flat course but follows the Lake and is just beautiful and quiet in winter. 

All fitness levels are encouraged to attend. Please let me know if you want to do some harness try on as I will bring my try on kit. 

If your dog is reactive please let me know so we can make accommodation. 

As always please come prepared to pick up after your dog. 

I look forward to seeing you all!

I will post some maps and the route later.  I apologize for the short notice, but I’ve been waiting for trail conditions to improve and they are great!

This is an out and back run and we will keep the pace appropriate to whomever shows to work on running with other canicrossers and overtaking/directional commands. The trail head parking lot is small, additional parking is available on the shoulder of the road. No admission or parking fees.

Come join us for a casual weekly meet up at the GE Trails to get in whatever kind of training your team needs. There are 11 miles of trails through shady forest to train on, and they all loop within a small area. This is a great park to switch dogs out as everything loops back to the parking lot. Parking is secure but there is no water, shade, or facilities on site so plan accordingly. As it cools off, most of the trails are suitable for bikejor too if you incorporate that with your running. This is the site of the Capitolina Dryland Challenge in January, and I can point you towards the race route if you want to preview. If you have any particular training needs or are just getting started and want to talk gear or starting a dog, we can always do that - just let me know!

Meetup is two events in one, both starting from the Wolf River Greenway Shady Grove Trailhead. All paces and beginner trail runners are welcome!
We meet almost every week on Sunday morning, so feel free to join us regularly!
The 7:00 am start will be a canicross trail run on the Wolf River White/Blue Trail. We will run approximately 4.5 miles at an easy pace.
At 9am, we will hike/walk approximately 2-3 miles on the Blue/Yellow trail for those that simply want a canihike or walking pace.
The Wolf River Trails are flat, non-technical trails located in the Lucius Burch State Natural Area at Shelby Farms Park, and a great place for beginners and experienced runners/hikers alike. The parking lot should have plenty of parking early in the morning, but fills up fast. There is additional parking at the office building across the street. Feel free to reach out with any questions.
